 *    The Village People - 100p
 *
 *    It's the year 980. We need you to start the digital
 *    revolution (just accept that scenario :D)!
 *
 *    The King wants an automated system for new villages
 *    to shelter their citizens, based on their rank in society.
 *    Of course, citizens of lower rank will have to make space
 *    for more important citizens, and live on the streets!
 *    It's 980 - not every life is worth the same!
 *
 *    In case you forgot: The King is rank 0! Nothing is beyond
 *    the King. Nobles are rank 1. And Citizens range from
 *    rank 2-4. A random rank should be assigned in their
 *    constructor.
 *
 *    In the name of the king, we give you this file.
 *              >>> Do not change this file! <<<
 *    Just add other files ot make it work.
 *    How? Find a way, or you will hang coming tuesday!
